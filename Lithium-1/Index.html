                    <h1>Description</h1>
                    <p>Kelp is known for being able to absorb and store heavy metals and other pollutants from the environment. This property could possibly be used in developing new bioremediation technologies for cleaning up contaminated water and soil. 
                      Heavy metals such as lead and mercury, as well as radioactive isotopes such as iodine-131 and cesium-137, can be absorbed by kelp from the surrounding water. Heavy metals could otherwise lower energy levels and damage organs (Jaishankar et al., 2014) and radioactive isotopes could increase the risk of cancers or cause radiation sickness (CDC, 2018).</p>
                    <p>Bioremediation is the process of removing toxins from the environment using living organisms. Through phytoremediation, marine macroalgae like kelp and seaweed were shown to be successful in removing different pollutants from aquatic environments. Heavy metals, chemical compounds, and other toxins in water are absorbed and accumulated by these algae, eliminating them from the environment. The algae may then be utilized for various applications, including biofuels, fertilizers, and animal feed. 
                      Furthermore, the production of these algae can potentially give economic advantages to coastal communities. The bioremediation potential of marine macroalgae is an important field of study, with continuous attempts to refine the process and discover novel uses.</p>
                    <p>Through research, kelp was found to be useful in the remediation of polluted water in regions such as industrial zones and mining sites. 
                      According to research published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, a dangerous amount of toxic metals such as mercury and lead can be seen absorbed in seaweed in Europe and Asia, showing the feasibility of using seaweed for bioremediation (Paz et al., 2019). This research on the bioremediation potential of marine macroalgae takes a multidisciplinary approach, combining chemical and biology concepts.
                      To completely comprehend how macroalgae absorb and eliminate pollutants from the environment, it is vital to examine their chemical mechanisms and how they interact with various contaminants.</p>

                  <h1>Chemistry</h1>
                  <p>Chelation, adsorption, and ion exchange are important processes in macroalgae that help in bioremediation. Chelation is the process of a metal ion binding to a molecule, forming a complex. In algae, there are molecules called siderophores which are able to chelate iron ions and transport them into the algae's cells (Årstøl & Hohmann-Marriott, 2019). Marine brown algae contain a sugar alcohol called mannitol. Mannitol (C6H14O6) has a hydroxyl (-OH) group structure that can bind to metal ions due to lone electron pairs forming coordination bonds with metal ions, forming a stable complex that the algae can easily excrete (Doleźal et al., 1973). 
                      This can help detoxify heavy metals like cadmium and mercury in macroalgae, as the metal-mannitol complexes are less toxic and can be more easily eliminated by the algae. Ion exchange in algae occurs when the negatively charged polysaccharides in the algae's cell walls bind with positively charged ions such as calcium and magnesium, allowing the algae to accumulate nutrients. The two aforementioned mechanisms fall under the process of adsorption. It is the process of molecules adhering to the surface of a solid or liquid. Macroalgae are known to be able to adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals like cadmium or mercury, and organic compounds too such as pesticides or herbicides (Ordóñez et al., 2023). 
                      Because of the large surface area of macroalgae, they are a very useful tool that can be used to control large amounts of pollutants. These chemical mechanisms facilitated by biological processes can be utilized for bioremediation, as they are useful in removing and absorbing pollutants and heavy metals from contaminated water and soil.</p>

                  <h1>Biology</h1>
                  <p>Bioaccumulation and biodegradation are two important biological processes in macroalgae that help assist in bioremediation. Bioaccumulation refers to the accumulation of substances, such as pollutants or nutrients, in living organisms over time. Macroalgae bioaccumulate essential nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus for plant growth, but they can also accumulate harmful pollutants such as microplastics and heavy metals (Paz et al., 2019). Biodegradation refers to the process in which organic substances are broken down by living organisms such as bacteria or protozoa, as they use the organic compounds as a source of energy by breaking them down into simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide and water. 
                    In the context of bioremediation, biodegradation of macroalgae can be used to break down pollutants into less harmful compounds. Some species of macroalgae have been shown to be effective at degrading organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and petroleum hydrocarbons (Bisht et al., 2015). One specific type of macroalgae, kelp, gets rid of greenhouse gases like CO2 by absorbing it into its tissues and using it in photosynthesis, which is the process of using energy from sunlight and nutrients to make food, lessening the CO2 concentration in the environment (Churchill & Daniel, 2021). 
                    This is beneficial for the environment since excessive greenhouse gases raise the Earth's temperatures.  With these biological processes, macroalgae helps reduce the concentration of pollutants in the surrounding ecosystem, and assists in creating a sustainable environment.

                  <h1>Physics</h1>
                  <p>Diffusion and mass transfer are two processes in macroalgae that fall under physics. Mass transfer is the movement of a substance from one location to another (Lewis, 1996). Two aforementioned processes, ion exchange and adsorption, involve the transfer of pollutants from the environment to the macroalgae surface, therefore involving mass transfer. The rate of this mass transfer depends on multiple factors such as the concentration of the pollutant, the surface area of the macroalgae, or the flow rate of the water. Diffusion is a specific type of mass transfer. It is the movement of molecules from a high concentration to low concentration. 
                   This can assist in bioremediation as when contaminants such as pesticides or heavy metals come into contact with the macroalgae, those particles can be diffused into the algal cells and interact with molecules of two aforementioned processes, chelation and adsorption, and be converted into detoxified and remediated substances which are then diffused back into the environment. With the help of these physical processes, macroalgae can be used as tools for bioremediation.</p>

                  <h1>Application</h1>
                  <p> The research on bioremediation with macroalgae, particularly kelp and seaweed, can help to create effective and long-lasting strategies for cleaning up polluted aquatic habitats, providing a habitat for marine life and improving the state of the Earth. These techniques may be used in a range of situations, including industrial, agricultural, and residential settings. 
                    Workers in aquatic environment management or creating bioremediation technologies can be assisted by the findings of this study, guiding their judgments on using kelp and seaweed to clear up pollutants. Furthermore, additional studies may be performed to investigate the potential of different forms of macroalgae for bioremediation applications. As the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions continues to grow, the use of macroalgae in bioremediation and other applications is likely to become increasingly important.

                  <p>   Diffusion and mass transfer are two processes in macroalgae that fall under physics. Mass transfer is the movement of a substance from one location to another (Lewis, 1996). Two aforementioned processes, ion exchange and adsorption, involve the transfer of pollutants from the environment to the macroalgae surface, therefore involving mass transfer. The rate of this mass transfer depends on multiple factors such as the concentration of the pollutant, the surface area of the macroalgae, or the flow rate of the water. Diffusion is a specific type of mass transfer. It is the movement of molecules from a high concentration to low concentration. 
                   This can assist in bioremediation as when contaminants such as pesticides or heavy metals come into contact with the macroalgae, those particles can be diffused into the algal cells and interact with molecules of two aforementioned processes, chelation and adsorption, and be converted into detoxified and remediated substances which are then diffused back into the environment. With the help of these physical processes, macroalgae can be used as tools for bioremediation.</p>
